"""
Application startup hook. Starts the Master Scheduler exactly once.

Two things this guards against:
  1. Calling start() twice in the same process (accidental double-init).
  2. Flask's debug-mode reloader, which runs the app in TWO processes --
     without the guard below, both would start their own scheduler,
     silently double-executing every job.
