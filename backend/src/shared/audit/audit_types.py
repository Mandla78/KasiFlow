"""
Audit event contracts — neutral ground.

Both publishers (Auth today; Business, Supplier, Marketplace, Wallet later)
and the consumer (Security's audit service) import from here. Living in
shared/ is what keeps the dependency arrow correct: Auth never imports
Security, Security never imports Auth, both import these types.

Nothing in this file is Authentication-specific. Event NAME VALUES
themselves live in shared/audit/event_types/ (one small file per real
domain), not here -- this file holds the DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC transport
contract (AuditEvent, AuditDomain, ActorType, AuditCategory,
AuditSeverity, AuditStatus) that every domain's events share regardless
of their own specific names.
