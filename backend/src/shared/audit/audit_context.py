"""
Automatic request-context enrichment for audit events.

WHY THIS EXISTS: the audit model wants IP, user agent, endpoint, HTTP
method, correlation ID, etc. Threading all of those through every
service-layer function signature would mean touching every call site in
auth_service.py / otp_service.py / password_reset_service.py — and would
mean every FUTURE domain has to remember to pass them too. Instead this
module pulls them from Flask's request context automatically, so
publishers only supply what they actually know (user id, email, outcome).

CRITICAL PROPERTY — must degrade gracefully with no request context.
Audit events are published from at least three places with no HTTP
request at all:
    - the scheduled cleanup job (background thread, app context only)
    - future CLI/management commands
    - tests calling services directly
Every function here returns None rather than raising when there is no
request. A background job that crashes at 3am because the audit layer
assumed a request object would be a self-inflicted outage.

    Best-effort (browser, os, platform) from a User-Agent string.

    Deliberately a crude substring check rather than a dependency on a
    UA-parsing library: these fields are display conveniences for the
    admin panel, not security controls, and a wrong guess is harmless.
    If richer device analytics ever matter, swap in a real parser here —
    this is the only place that would change.

    MOBILE-APP OS DETECTION — React Native / Expo's built-in fetch/XHR
    does NOT send a browser-style UA containing literal "android" or

        Android (OkHttp)  -> contains "okhttp" and often "dalvik"/"linux"

    A plain browser-style check (looking only for "android"/"iphone")
    correctly identifies "this is a mobile app" via the okhttp/expo
    check above, but then falls through on OS — which is exactly the
    null operating_system/platform observed in real device testing.
