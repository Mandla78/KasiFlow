"""
IdempotencyKey -- the stored result of a request, so a retry returns
the same answer instead of doing the same thing twice.

THE FAILURE THIS PREVENTS (V2_13 §3.1). A supplier's ERP posts a
product. The connection times out at fifteen seconds. The ERP has no
way to know whether we processed it, so -- correctly -- it retries. We
create a SECOND product. Nobody notices until their catalogue has
doubled.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THIS CANNOT BE ENGINEERED AWAY ON THE CLIENT. If a request times out
  the caller genuinely cannot tell whether the server processed it.
  Retrying is CORRECT behaviour. The fix is on our side.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCOPED TO (key, user_id), not to the key alone. Clients generate keys
themselves, and two suppliers independently choosing the same UUID
must not see each other's responses -- which is exactly the kind of
cross-tenant leak a global key space invites.

THE REQUEST FINGERPRINT IS WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A CACHE. Reusing one
key for a DIFFERENT request is a client bug, and returning the first
response would hide it -- the caller would believe their second,
different request succeeded. Storing a hash of the body lets that be
refused loudly instead.

PLAIN db.Model, like the history tables: a stored response has no
business being soft-deleted, and rows leave by expiry alone.
