"""
MediaUploadRecord -- one row per successfully registered upload,
regardless of which domain triggered it (Products today; a future
profile-photo or verification-document domain later). This is the
piece a purely per-domain limit can't provide: an account that stays
under Products' own tier limit, and under a future profile-photo
domain's own limit, and under a future verification-doc domain's own
limit, INDIVIDUALLY, could still be abusing all three AT ONCE. Only a
shared, cross-domain ledger catches that pattern -- it lives in
shared/media specifically because this is the one place that
genuinely sees every domain's uploads.

Lives in the shared "platform" schema, not "supplier" -- this table will
record uploads from business accounts too (profile photos, proof of
payment) the moment those domains exist; putting it in "supplier"
would be wrong from day one.

account_id IS DELIBERATELY GENERIC, NOT supplier_profile_id -- once a
business-role upload exists, this same table needs to record THAT
account's usage too. No FK to any one domain's own account table,
matching the pattern already established for cross-cutting concerns
(audit_events has the same generic user_id shape rather than a
supplier_profile_id FK).
