"""
Webhook service -- verifies the caller is genuinely Cloudinary, parses
the scan result, then dispatches to whichever DOMAIN registered
itself as owning that asset's public_id. shared/media still doesn't
know what a "product" is: products/services/product_media_service.py
calls register_scan_result_handler(folder_naming.is_supplier_product_asset,
apply_scan_result) once at app startup (see src/__init__.py).

MATCHER FUNCTIONS, NOT PREFIX STRINGS -- the who-owns-it-first folder
taxonomy (akayza/supplier/{key}/products/{product-key}/...,
see folder_naming.py's own docstring) means there's no longer a fixed
string every product asset starts with -- supplier_profile_id is a
variable UUID sitting BEFORE the "products" segment. Each domain
supplies its own predicate (public_id -> bool) instead, giving it full
control over how it recognises its own assets regardless of where in
the path that recognition needs to happen.

IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT BY ACCIDENT -- this file itself does
no idempotency check; it's the REGISTERED HANDLER's job (see
product_media_service.apply_scan_result's own docstring) to no-op if
the row it's about to update is already in a terminal state. Webhook
senders retry; a duplicate delivery must never double-process.
