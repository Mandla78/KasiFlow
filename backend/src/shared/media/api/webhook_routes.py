"""
Cloudinary notification webhook. NO @fully_authenticated -- Cloudinary
itself is calling this, not a signed-in Akayza user. The HMAC
signature (verified inside webhook_service.handle_scan_webhook) is the
ONLY authorization this endpoint has, which is exactly why that
verification is not optional and not best-effort.

NAMED "notifications", NOT "scan" -- Cloudinary sends MORE THAN ONE
kind of notification to this SAME url: an "upload" notification (fires
the instant a file lands, before any scanning) and a real "moderation"
notification (the actual scan verdict) both arrive here. Cloudinary
only supports ONE configurable URL per upload -- there's no way to
have these land on separate endpoints -- so this file's own job is
telling them apart correctly (see webhook_service.py's own docstring
for the dispatch side, and cloudinary_provider.py's parse_scan_result
for where the "upload" vs "moderation" distinction actually gets made).
A name implying "scan-only" undersold what actually flows through
here, discovered during real device testing.

Always returns 200 on anything short of a bad signature -- webhook
senders retry aggressively on non-2xx, and retrying a webhook whose
public_id this backend doesn't recognise, or whose handler already
no-op'd because the row is already terminal, would just be wasted
retries for both sides.
