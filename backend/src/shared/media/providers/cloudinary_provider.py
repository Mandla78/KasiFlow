"""
CloudinaryMediaProvider -- the ONLY file in this codebase that imports
the `cloudinary` package. Everything else depends on MediaProvider
(provider.py), never this class directly, never the SDK directly.

SIGNING IS 100% LOCAL, NO NETWORK CALL -- cloudinary.utils.sign_request
computes an HMAC locally using the api_secret this process holds; it
never talks to Cloudinary's servers. This matters for THIS backend's
own test suite: generate_signed_upload is fully unit-testable without
any network access, and this environment's own network policy doesn't
allow reaching api.cloudinary.com anyway -- confirmed directly, not
assumed, before building this file. The only genuinely networked half
of an upload (the client posting bytes straight to Cloudinary) never
touches this backend at all, by design -- see generate_signed_upload's
own docstring on the SignedUpload contract.

WEBHOOK VERIFICATION USES CLOUDINARY'S OWN SDK FUNCTION
(verify_notification_signature), not a hand-rolled HMAC comparison --
confirmed against the actual installed SDK's source before writing
this: it reads api_secret from the global cloudinary.config(), takes
the raw body/timestamp/signature, and has REPLAY PROTECTION built in
(rejects a signature older than `valid_for` seconds, 7200 by default;
this class passes MediaConfig's own signature_valid_for_seconds
instead so the two use the same window as the upload signature).

INGEST-TIME COMPRESSION -- every upload (signed or backend-initiated)
carries a `transformation` param capping the STORED dimensions
(c_limit,w_X,h_X,q_auto), not just the accepted upload size. This is
the real fix for "a ZIP full of real phone photos will still be huge
even compressed" (raised during review): the size cap on what's
ACCEPTED and the size of what's actually STORED are two different
numbers, and only the second one matters for real Cloudinary cost.
q_auto additionally lets Cloudinary pick the best quality/compression
tradeoff automatically, rather than storing at a fixed quality that's
either wasteful or visibly degraded.
