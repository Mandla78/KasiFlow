MediaConfig -- ONLY what's genuinely universal across every future
media consumer: Cloudinary credentials and signature timing. Nothing
here is a business rule.

WHAT USED TO LIVE HERE AND WHY IT DOESN'T ANYMORE: photo-count limits,
allowed formats, and max file size were originally defined in this
file, discovered during review to be a real leak -- those are
Products-specific decisions (a profile photo isn't tier-gated by
count, a verification document isn't always an image, a future
domain's size ceiling has nothing to do with Products' own). Each
consuming domain now owns its own limits entirely -- see
products/tiers/ for Products' own numbers. This file only holds what
would be identical no matter which domain is uploading.
