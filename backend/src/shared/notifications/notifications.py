"""
Notification publishing -- mirrors shared/audit/audit.py's own
mechanism exactly (register_listener/publish/_listeners), reusing a
pattern already proven in this exact codebase rather than inventing a
new one.

This module knows nothing about databases, roles, or stock orders. It
builds nothing itself -- callers construct a complete NotificationEvent
and hand it to publish(). It just makes sure that event reaches
whichever domain has registered to persist it. domains/platform/
notifications subscribes to this; it never reaches toward that domain.

WHY publish() ENQUEUES RATHER THAN WRITING SYNCHRONOUSLY: a business
confirming an order shouldn't wait on a notification row being written
before their own request returns -- same "the action succeeding must
never depend on a side-effect succeeding" reasoning already applied to
audit logging. Routed through shared.queue.enqueue(), the SAME
background job infrastructure EmailService, AuditService, and
BulkImport already use. That module's own docstring says exactly what
this gets for free: swapping the in-process thread pool for a real
message broker (Celery/RQ/SQS) later means changing shared/queue/
queue.py's own internals ONLY -- nothing here, and nothing at any call
site of publish(), needs to change when that day comes.
