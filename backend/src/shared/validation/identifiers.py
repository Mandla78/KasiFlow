"""
Identifier normalization — turns messy real-world input into the
canonical form used for INDEXED MATCHING (not display). Scope matches
this module's sibling validators.py: infrastructure-level, format/shape
only, never business rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS: nothing in this codebase normalized phone numbers
before Supplier Discovery needed it (confirmed by reading
user_repository.py — email normalization there is just an inline
`.strip().lower()`, and nothing touches phone at all). Real South
African phone input varies too much for that inline-regex approach to
be safe here — leading zero vs +27, spaces, dashes, users pasting a
number with a stray "tel:" prefix. Using `phonenumbers` (Google's
libphonenumber, the same library iOS/Android's own dialers use) is
worth the dependency rather than re-deriving that logic badly.

Shared here (not owned by connections alone) since normalizing
a phone number for matching is a cross-cutting concern other domains
will eventually want too (OTP delivery already touches phone numbers,
just doesn't normalize them for matching yet).
