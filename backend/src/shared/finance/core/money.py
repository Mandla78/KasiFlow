"""
The Money value object -- what money IS in Akayza.

THREE PROPERTIES, ALL DELIBERATE:

1. INTEGER MINOR UNITS ONLY. Money is stored as a whole number of a
   currency's smallest unit (cents for ZAR), never as a float. Floats
   cannot represent every decimal fraction exactly -- 0.1 + 0.2 famously
   isn't 0.3 -- and those tiny errors compound across many transactions
   until a shop owner's total is a cent off. A shop owner spotting
   "my total is wrong by 1c" destroys trust in every other number the
   app shows.

2. CURRENCY-CARRYING. Every Money knows its own currency, even though
   Akayza is ZAR-only today. A bare number can be added to any
   other bare number; a Money can only be added to Money of the SAME
   currency, enforced below. That makes cross-currency bugs impossible
   rather than merely unlikely, and costs nothing to add now versus an
   enormous retrofit later.

3. IMMUTABLE. Operations return NEW Money objects; nothing is ever
   mutated in place. An amount that can be silently changed after
   validation is an amount you cannot reason about -- immutability means
   a validated Money stays validated.
