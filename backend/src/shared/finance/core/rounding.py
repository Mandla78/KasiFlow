Rounding strategies.

Every rounding decision in the platform goes through here, so the answer
to "how does Akayza round?" is one file, not scattered per-feature
guesses that quietly disagree with each other.

Uses Python's `decimal` module rather than round()/float arithmetic:
Python's built-in round() uses banker's rounding on floats and inherits
every float precision problem, which is exactly what this engine exists
to avoid.

    HALF_UP -- 0.5 rounds away from zero (2.5 -> 3). What most people
        intuitively expect, and what South African retail pricing
        conventions assume. The engine default.

    HALF_EVEN -- 0.5 rounds to the nearest even digit (2.5 -> 2,
        3.5 -> 4), a.k.a. banker's rounding. Statistically unbiased
        across many roundings, which is why accounting systems often

        surprises people who expect 2.5 -> 3.
