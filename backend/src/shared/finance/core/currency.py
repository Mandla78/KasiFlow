Currency definitions.

WHY minor_units LIVES ON THE CURRENCY, not as a global constant:
"1 unit = 100 minor units" is true for ZAR and USD, but it is NOT
universal -- JPY has no minor unit at all (minor_units=0), and BHD/KWD
use three (1 dinar = 1000 fils). Hard-coding `precision = 2` anywhere in
this engine would silently produce wrong results the first time a
non-2-decimal currency appears, and retrofitting it later means auditing
every calculation, formatter, and stored value in the platform.

Defining it here costs almost nothing today and makes that entire class
of bug impossible.

Akayza is ZAR-only today. The non-ZAR entries below are NOT a claim
that those currencies are supported -- they exist so the precision logic
is exercised by real varied values in tests rather than being untested
theory.
