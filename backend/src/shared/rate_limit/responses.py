"""
The rate-limit-exceeded response handler.

DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC BY DESIGN: this module never imports a specific
domain's rate_limit/policies.py (previously it imported auth's
directly -- that coupling is exactly what this refactor removes).
Instead, each domain registers its own endpoint -> event mapping into _AUDIT_EVENT_REGISTRY via register_audit_events(), called
explicitly at app-boot time (see src/__init__.py's
_register_error_handlers). security/ owns the ENGINE; each domain owns
its own POLICY and registers into the shared engine -- the same
"registry a fresh app boot populates explicitly" idiom already used by
master_scheduler/registry.py and security/detection/registry.py, not a
new pattern invented for this file.

RESPONSE SHAPE IS A DELIBERATE, APPROVED EXCEPTION to this project's
general {"success": false, "message": ..., "errors": [], "code": ...}
envelope (see src/core/responses.py). The shape below --
{"error": "rate_limit_exceeded", "message": ..., "retry_after": N} --
was explicitly specified and approved for Phase 1. Noted here so a
future maintainer doesn't "fix" it back to the general envelope without
knowing that was a deliberate choice, not a miss.
