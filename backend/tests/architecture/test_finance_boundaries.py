ARCHITECTURE BOUNDARY TESTS -- the Finance Engine's isolation, enforced.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
"Finance must never know about domains" is a rule. Rules decay. Someone
rushing a feature writes

    from src.domains.informal_trader.credit_book.repositories import CreditRepository

inside Finance. Review misses it. Six months later Finance depends on
the credit book while the credit book depends on Finance, circular imports begin,
and untangling it is a project rather than a fix.

This test makes that impossible instead of merely discouraged: it parses
every file under shared/finance/ with Python's own AST module (not a
text search -- a regex would miss aliased or multi-line imports and
would false-positive on the word appearing in a docstring) and fails if
any forbidden import appears.

Same discipline as master_scheduler's test_registry_defines_no_jobs_itself:
verify the STRUCTURE, not just the behaviour.
